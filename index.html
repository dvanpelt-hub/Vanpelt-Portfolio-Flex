		    <h2>About Me</h2>      
		    <p>Hello! My name is Dan and I am an undergrad finance student at SNHU. I have a military background and have worked in several countries for the past four years. Web and Software Development has been an interest of mine for quite some time, and recently I decided it was time for a career change!</p>

        <p>I've chosen to participate in the Web Developer Bootcamp offered through Bloc and feel excited to meet others within the industry. Challenges and problem solving draw me in, and working with a team dedicated to completing projects and solving problems is exactly what I'm looking for. If you are looking for someone to assist in projects, please feel free to contact me!</p>
